unscented kalman filter
Advantages
Highly efficient
far more accuarte than EKF
no need of jacobian so easy to implement
can be strengthend
computational complexity same as EKF




can be used apply to detect anomaly ?








if state transition equations are expressed in the form of taylor series the error is of the fourth order of the taylor series expansion.
order of the error will be fourth deriviative of the f[.,.,.]
mean is predicted more accurately than EKF.
we can furhter strengthen the our results by simple adding another choice k.
