1) Advantages
O(n2) vs O(n4) 
2) Disadvantages

3) Scope for further development

kalman filter
basics techniques it uses= predict and update loop
time complexity
what kind of data will work best
improvements or integration ?
How to apply it best to the anomly part



advantages:
it doesnt require more of a previous time series data. (only the last time series data is required)
more accurate than the measured data.
Can be used to detect anomly in a very noisy data given the model is linear.
